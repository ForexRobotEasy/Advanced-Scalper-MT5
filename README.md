## Description

The Advanced Scalper MT5 is designed to execute high/low breakout trading strategies with advanced exit algorithms, spread-filter algorithm, slippage-control algorithms, and customization options. It also supports manual trading strategies.

2. Implement advanced exit algorithms using the `ImplementAdvancedExitAlgorithms()` function.
3. Implement the spread-filter algorithm using the `ImplementSpreadFilterAlgorithm()` function.
4. Implement slippage-control algorithms using the `ImplementSlippageControlAlgorithms()` function.
5. Enable full customization of the software using the `EnableCustomizationOptions()` function.
6. Implement recommended settings using the `ImplementRecommendedSettings()` function.
7. Support manual trading strategies using the `SupportManualTradingStrategies()` function.
8. If all the above steps are successful, continue with trading operations.
